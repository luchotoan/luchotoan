Hi, I’m @luchotoan — but you can call me Luis.

I'm a second-semester Systems Engineering student with a passion for programming, especially in web and Android development. I'm currently learning:

- C++
- Java
- Kotlin
- Android Studio
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

I'm eager to collaborate on beginner-friendly projects involving the technologies I'm learning, and I enjoy engaging in positive, constructive discussions around project ideas and implementations.

You can reach me here or via email: luchotoan@gmail.com.
